This gun mod is a fork of Guns Without Roses, created by Lykrast: https://github.com/Lykrast/GunsWithoutRoses

This fork of the mod expands on the weapon types possible to create, including a bunch of quake/doom inspired weapons.  This makes for a Vivecraft compatible experience for a gun mod that still keeps a fast pace.

This fork also exposes all of the values for each of the twelve weapons to the toml config.

This fork also includes a mixin and custom packet to fix long standing issues with projectiles for 1.16.5: fixing them inheriting player speed on accident, and fixing an issue where they could not go faster than a speed of 4, allowing for the new guns to reach snappier projectile speeds.

Textures are reused, provided by mcvinnyq, edited by Kaleidio as needed.
